career-profile:
    title: Who am I?
    summary: |
      For the almost last 10 years I have been working in IT, from desktop, web to mobile applications (iOS) using completely different stacks, programming languages and frameworks.
      I had the opportunity a few years ago to be in charge of more than 1200 nodes in 3 clusters, using k8s, docker and other tools for its orchestration by Intel, trying to keep the roadmap updated and running the workloads
      inside the nodes to test the hardware components in the clusters, including some core components such as: CPU, GPU, VRAM, MEMORY, MOTHERBOARD AND KNOBS.
      
      In the last 2 years in F5, I've been creating some testing solutions and doing automation for Azure such as pipelines and test suites, as well of mentoring.
      I eventually returned to development where I am currently in the telemetry and licensing team and the APIs we use as SAAS.
      
      Adapt to projects is a need, create solutions to make life easier for everyone and create a work that we can love (GPTW).
      Resilience to changes is an important part of being able to preserve this, which is why I love learning new technologies and ways to solve problems every day.
      
      Softskills (I always trying to improve these):
        - Communication, team work, listener, empathy, self-passionate learner, customer oriented, problem solver, big picture, good thinker 
        - Excellent communication and inter-personal skills
