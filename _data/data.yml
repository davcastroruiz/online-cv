    title: Who am I?
    summary: |
      Throughout my life, I have faced a unique challenge with the perception of time: my insatiable desire to learn. This yearning has led me to explore a variety of experiences, each valuable in its own right. My constant pursuit of knowledge guides me on this ephemeral journey, and I am grateful for every lesson I have had the fortune to learn.

      For almost 10 years, I have been working in IT, from desktop, web, to mobile applications (iOS) using various stacks, programming languages, and frameworks. In the last 2 years at F5, I have been creating testing solutions and automation for Azure, along with mentoring. I adapt to projects, create solutions to make life easier for everyone, and love what I do.

      Soft skills are essential, and I am always looking to improve in: communication, teamwork, empathy, self-driven learning, and customer orientation.
